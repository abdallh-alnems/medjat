# Specification Quality Checklist: Admin Support & App Control Center

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- "Control everything" was bounded via Assumptions to the Admin app acting as the single control plane (support replies + app control on top of existing admin areas), avoiding unbounded scope.
- Support audience scoped to company administrators (tenants), consistent with the existing support-ticket model where tickets are opened by tenant admins; employee-app direct support is explicitly out of scope for this version.
